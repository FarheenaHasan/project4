# Project4
Social Media Users Dataset

Hypothesis
User engagement on social media platforms varies significantly across demographics (e.g., age, gender) and interests.

Research Questions:
1.	How does screen time differ by age groups and gender across various social media platforms?
2.	Which interests or activities are most associated with high screen time on specific platforms?
3.	What are the top platforms in terms of user engagement in different countries or cities, and how do these preferences differ by demographics?
